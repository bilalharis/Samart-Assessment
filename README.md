# Smart Assessment â€“ Complete (Refactor)

This is a clean Vite + TypeScript project that **replicates your app UI and functionality**.

- Uses **React 19**, **lucide-react**, **recharts**
- Uses **Tailwind via CDN** (no build step) with the same color palette
- All data is **local** in `src/data/mockData.ts`
- Role-based login (Principal, Teacher, Parent, Student)
- Dashboards: Principal, Teacher, Student, Parent
- Features: Performance charts, Assessment builder, Lesson planner, Custom lessons, Notifications, PDF download for principal

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Optional: set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a `.env` if you later want to re-enable AI calls (not required for current build).
